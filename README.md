<h2 >Artfull</h2>
<br>
<p>This repository contains version 1.4 of my Sega Master System entry, Artfull, into the SMS-Power coding competition: this is the game ROM, manual and Z80 ASM source code. Ther Artfull software is created entirely in Z80 Assmebly language. Artfull is a picture guessing game for teams where the pictures are drawn using a custom interpreted (MergeDraw) language.</p>
<br>
<p>The game got a score of 5.78 from 9 points or 64% in the competition.</p>
<br>
<p>Note that this is a 2 in 1 software: the game and the MergeDraw programming language. The above two can be selected from the title screen.</p>
<br>
<p>What makes this software interesting and unique? This software contains the first (interpreted) language specially designed for the Sega Master System that uses  non-custom hardware, which is the MergeDraw language, which allows the user to input their own programs (in MergeDraw) and run them. A coding first for the Sega Master System. The generation of 8-bit general purpose home computers which dominated the 1980s era of home computing, includes the ZX-Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC 464, all included a built in interpreter, for a BASIC language, which was part of their operating systems and the interpreted language was specifically designed for them and coded in assembly language. Not suprisingly the Sega Master System, even though it has been released in 1986, did NOT include a built in interpreted language specifically designed for it-this is at least because it is a game console and not a general pupose home computer, and an fullly usable interpreter coded in assembly language is not a straightfoward thing to code from scratch.Also there is no game that exists for the Sega master System, prior to Artfull, that contains an interpreter as a gameplay element-allowing the gamer to enter custom programs to be interpreted and run.</p>
<br>
<p>So Artfull is the first game for the Sega Master System that has an embedded interpreter which can take and run programs from the player while the game runs. Another coding first for the Sega Master System.</p>
